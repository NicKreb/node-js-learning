Middleware are functions and bits of code that runs between the request and response

such as: app.use(func) and app.get('/', func).

The order of middleware is incredibly important for how it runs. 

Middleware Examples:
* Logger Middleware to log details of every request
* Authentication check middleware for protected routes
* Middleware to parse JSON data from requests
* Return 404 pages

Static files are like jpeg image files, etc..

By creating an use() function that includes express.statc() as the arg I can 
now put in a string with a file/folder name within the static function and it will
allow link elements within the folder to affect the html. Otherwise, beforehand
I would have had to bake the styles code, for example, in to the html directly
with a styles element. In a way, this also lets me separate what public can access
and what they can't.

------ DataBases -------

SQL:
use tables, rows, and columns to store data

NoSQL:
uses Collections and Documents to store data
    - a collection would be a series of User Documents, or in the case of the blog site
    a series of Blog document.

    -a document in this case represents a single item(a single blog) of data in the data base:
    example of a document:
    {
        "_id": ObjectId(12345),
        "title": "Opening Party",
        "snippet": "All about the...",
        "body": "blah blah blah...."
    }
